Prints an integer number in English


Some time ago, Google used to print searched numbers in English. Just for fun, I wanted to
replicate that behavior.
The program accepts as input any integer number with up to 66 digits, which is the biggest
number the English language has a name for (vigintillion), at least itâ€™s the biggest I
could find.
